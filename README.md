Hello 
Greetings, this is James Guinto and Ivan Reyes of STEM 1 - Innovation and we are very happy to share our web page.

  Our webpage is all about our small business. The name of our business is Whip-O-Wrench which is a automobile tuning and repair shop. We offer a lot of services such as car repairs, bodykit installations, car wraps, engine swaps, exhaust upgrades, rim change, and many more. We also work with famous automotive brands like Liberty Walk, VeilSide, Top Secret, BBS LM, Work, Nismo, and many more. Our main goal with our business is to make people happy by helping them with their car performance or repair needs. Most important of all, we want to deliver high quality services and products to our customers at a lower price compared to other tuning and repair shops. We also want to ensure the safety and the reliability of our customer's vehicles by providing auto-servicing needs and not only that, we also want to help our customer's maintain their vehicle's value as much as possible by having a proper and scheduled vehicle maintenance.
